- **VM**: Virtual Machine  
- **ISO**: Disk image used for OS installation  
- **Snapshot**: A saved VM state at a point in time  
- **vSphere**: VMwareâ€™s virtualization management platform

## Procedure Steps

### Step 1: Planning  
- Identify VM purpose (e.g., web app testing, internal tools).  
- Define CPU, RAM, disk size, and networking needs.  
- Check host capacity and datastore availability.  
- Confirm OS version and licensing requirements.

### Step 2: VM Creation  
- Log in to vSphere with secure credentials.  
- Right-click the target host or cluster, select **New Virtual Machine**.  
- Choose **Custom Configuration**, assign VM name and resource pool.  
- Select datastore and compatibility level.  
- Allocate CPU, RAM, and disk resources.  
- Configure network adapter, assign to appropriate VLAN.

### Step 3: OS Installation  
- Mount the installation ISO media.  
- Boot VM from ISO and install the OS (set language, timezone, users).  
- Perform system updates and install tools like VMware Tools.

### Step 4: Testing and Hardening  
- Verify network connectivity internally and externally.  
- Confirm VM boots without errors.  
- Run functional tests as required.  
- Set strong passwords, enable firewall, disable unnecessary services.

### Step 5: Documentation and Transfer  
- Log VM details: hostname, IP address, OS version, assigned owner, and purpose.  
- Take a snapshot if applicable.  
- Share credentials securely with the responsible team.
